My CodeWars solutions, seperated by their kata KYU level.

- The instructions will be at the top of each file.
- My solution will be posted along with the running time.
- If I have another solution it will be posted (commented out) with it's running time.
- A solution written by someone else will also be included (commented out).

// TODO: Seperate each problem to their own folder with readme for each?
// ADD: How it works / thought process / what I learned for each?
